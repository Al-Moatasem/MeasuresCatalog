#### Production Adjustments  
Start with a sum of all non-drug-related transaction charges where the partner was listed as the Patient Responsible Provider, but a different physician was listed as the Provider on Ticket. Then subtract any non-drug-related transactions where the partner was listed as the Provider on Ticket, but a different physician was listed as the Patient Responsible Provider. Add back in any non-drug-related charges where the partner was listed as the Provider on Ticket, and a non-partner was the other physician listed as the Patient Responsible Provider. Finally, any non-drug-related transactions where a non-partner is listed as both the Patient Responsible Provider and the Provider on Ticket is distributed equally among all providers.  
#### Production Charges  
Sum of all non-drug-related transactions with the partner listed as the 'Provider on Ticket'.  
#### Production Percent  
An estimate of the amount of business that is generated for the clinic by each partner.  It is calculated as the percent of non-drug-related charges that each partner generates.  Charges generated by non-partners are attributed based on the responsible provider in the patient’s record.  If the responsible provider is also not a partner, the charge is distributed equally among all providers.  To avoid one month drastically changing a partner’s production percent, the final production percent is based on the aggregated six month value for an individual partner divided by the aggregated six month value for all partners.
